 * [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org/) - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.

## Tools that we love and use:

* [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org/) - The human interface to your operations. [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org/) features fine-grain access controls, a built-in job scheduler, and the ability to define workflows that dispatch commands and scripts to your nodes.
